    <h1>Collection of Past Works</h1>
    <h2 id="project1">Project 1 - <i>Silver Blood</i></h2>
      <p>01</p>
      <img src="./assets/Red_Queen_Mockup.png" alt="Mockup display of a fictional book, Red Queen" width="500" height="auto">
      <hr>
      <p>For this project, I created a fictional sequel to the <i>Red Queen</i> series, designing a new book called <i>Silver Blood</i> that could seamlessly 
        fit into a series of five or more existing titles. The goal was to extend the story as a continuation while maintaining consistency with 
        the established characters, themes, and visual style. Using <strong>Adobe InDesign</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>, I designed a book cover that blended smoothly 
        with the existing series while standing out as a fresh addition. This project emphasized <strong>layout, typography, and visual cohesion</strong>, ensuring 
        the new title felt like a natural extension of the series.</p>
    <h2 id="project2">Project 2 - <i>Ferrari Magazine Rebrand</i></h2>
      <p>02</p>

      <img src="./assets/Magazine_Ferrari_Spread.png" alt="Mockup display of a fictional magazine spread for TopGear" width="500" height="auto">
      <hr>
      <p>For this project, I created a rebranded magazine issue for <strong>TopGear</strong>, focusing on <i>Ferrari</i> as the central theme. The assignment required designing 
        both a magazine cover and a spread from an existing publication, allowing me to put my own creative spin on the original layout. Using <strong>Adobe InDesign</strong> 
        for layout and <strong>Photoshop</strong> for image editing, I designed a cohesive, visually striking magazine that reflected Ferrari’s iconic style while adhering to 
        the magazine’s established aesthetic. This project emphasized <strong>typography, composition, and visual hierarchy</strong>, ensuring each page was engaging, readable, 
        and true to the brand identity.</p>
    <h2 id="project3">Project 3 - <i>IvyOra Font Advertisement</i></h2>
      <p>03</p>
      <img src="./assets/Type_Speciman_Magazine.jpg" alt="Mockup display of an IvyOra Typeface magazine spread" width="500" height="auto">
      <hr>
      <p>For this project, I chose the font <i>IvyOra</i> and created an advertisement highlighting its design and versatility. I designed a magazine spread in the style 
        of a real advertisement, focusing on a music-themed layout. Using primarily <strong>Adobe InDesign</strong>, I emphasized <strong>typographic hierarchy, cascading elements, and 
        visual flow</strong> to guide the viewer’s eye through the spread. The design also includes close-ups of the font’s serifs and several of its glyphs subtly placed in 
        the background to showcase its unique features and artistic details. This project allowed me to explore how type can communicate mood, style, and branding 
        within a visually compelling composition.</p>
    <h2 id="project4">Project 4 - <i>White Heron Castle Poster</i></h2>
      <p>04</p>
      <img src="./assets/White_Heron_Poster.png" alt="Mockup display of a White Heron Poster" width="500" height="auto">
      <hr>
      <p>For this project, I designed a poster for the <i>White Heron Castle</i>, a historical monument in Japan. The assignment required choosing a monument and creating a visually 
        compelling poster that communicated its history and significance. Using both <strong>Adobe InDesign</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>, I combined images, typography, and layout elements to create 
        a clear, engaging design. I also included a small timeline on the poster to highlight key historical moments of the castle, giving viewers context while maintaining a 
        balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition. This project emphasized <strong>visual storytelling, composition, and effective information hierarchy</strong>.</p>
