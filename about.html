    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="./assets/Me.jpg" alt="A selfie of the website owner" width="300">
    <p>Hi, my name is Jennifer Rattana. I began my journey in graphic design after graduating high school in 2021. 
      As a newcomer to the field, I’m still exploring where life and design will take me, but I’m steadily honing my 
      skills and learning more every day.
    </p>
    <p>I grew up in a household full of culinary parents and grandparents, and I’m proud to be the first in my 
      family to attend college. In my family, I’m known as the creative one, although I can be a bit stubborn at times. 
      My curiosity and creativity have always pushed me to explore new ways to express myself.
    </p>
    <h2>Programs I've Worked With:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Illustrator</li>
        <li>Indesign</li>
        <li>Photoshop</li>
        <li>Clip Studio Paint</li>
        <li>Blender</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Outside of design, I enjoy puzzles and games like chess. To me, graphic design is like a puzzle, trying to fit 
      different pieces together until everything aligns and makes sense. My fascination with scrapbooking and journals inspired 
      me to pursue graphic design, as it felt like a natural extension of my love for organizing and creating visually 
      appealing pieces.
